# Drug-Consumption-Analysis-Project
Python for data analysis project. The objective was to analyse a given dataset and create models to make predictions. The dataset that was given to me is "drug consumption analysis" that you can find here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29

Since there was up to 18 classes to predict, I had to make a lot of models. Finally, I took the best estimator for each drug.

The models are saved in models/--.sav
The columns associated to the models are saved in models/_columns

You can watch the analysis and model prodiction in the notebook file, and then launch the 'app.py' and enter your characteristics to see if the model predicted which drug are you consuming.
